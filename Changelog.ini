- Ron Savage is now co-maint.
- Re-write MySQL-specific code, which is only used in the tests.
- Rename Changes to CHANGES.
- Use ini.report.pl (shipped with Module::Metadata::Changes) to add Changelog.ini to the distro.
- Reformat the dates in this file.
- Clean up the POD.
- Re-work Makefile.PL rather than have Build.PL generate it.
- Copy sub _strip_options() from Tree and add to Tree::Persist::Base. Then call it from within the
subs returned from _add_child_handler() and _remove_child_handler().
This resolves RT#61740, thereby allowing trees to be read in from a db and inserted into another
tree, and visa versa, i.e. allow trees to be inserted into a tree read in from a db.
- Add t/008_add_from_db.t to test this patch.
- Add an FAQ, whose first item explains using $ENV{DBI_DSN} etc to control the test database,
and that DBD::SQLite is used by default.
- Add code to File::Temp -> newdir(...) in tests to help run under BSD-based systems.
- Add scripts/xml.demo.pl and scripts/store.xml.
