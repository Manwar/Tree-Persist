Revision history for Perl distribution Tree::Persist

1.08  Sat Jun 22 10:39:00 2013
	- Switch from File::Copy's cp() to its copy(), as a presumed fix for file permission problems copying
		test files from t/datafiles to a temp dir.

1.07  Fri Jun 21 15:35:00 2013
	- Patch tests to allow for CPAN testers who run with an un-writable temp dir.

1.06  Thu Jun 20 11:53:00 2013
	- Replace Test::File::Cleaner with File::Temp because the t/ directory is read-only.
		Now, a temp dir is used instead of trying and failing to write to t/.

1.05  Mon Jun 17 17:13:00 2013
	- Update pre-reqs yet again.

1.04  Thu Jun 13 12:50:00 2013
	- Add Module::Runtime to pre-reqs in Build.PL and Makefile.PL. This is a bad oversight on my part.

1.03  Tue Jun 11 17:04:00 2013
	- Fix some tests which had stopped working.
	- Implement user-specified class names for deflation/inflation of objects.
		This was requested in a module review: http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Tree-Persist#10829.
		The new code uses Module::Runtime.
		This also means the 'type' parameter to connect() and create_datastore() is no longer mandatory.
		Instead, a 'class' parameter can be used to supply the name of a deflator/inflator class.
		See t/load_from_file.t and t/save_and_load.t for sample code.
	- Replace UNIVERSAL::require with Module::Runtime in various modules.
	- Update PODs.
	- Rename test files from \d\d\d_*.t to *.t.

1.02  Thu Nov  8 12:38:00 2012
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
	- Add README.

1.01  Thu Oct  4 10:27:00 2012
	- Ron Savage is now co-maint.
	- Re-write MySQL-specific code, which is only used in the tests.
	- Rename Changes to CHANGES.
	- Use ini.report.pl (shipped with Module::Metadata::Changes) to add Changelog.ini to the distro.
	- Reformat the dates in this file.
	- Clean up the POD.
	- Re-work Makefile.PL rather than have Build.PL generate it.
	- Copy sub _strip_options() from Tree and add to Tree::Persist::Base. Then call it from within the
		subs returned from _add_child_handler() and _remove_child_handler().
		This resolves RT#61740, thereby allowing trees to be read in from a db and inserted into another
		tree, and visa versa, i.e. allow trees to be inserted into a tree read in from a db.
	- Add t/008_add_from_db.t to test this patch.
	- Add an FAQ, whose first item explains using $ENV{DBI_DSN} etc to control the test database,
		and that DBD::SQLite is used by default.
	- Add code to File::Temp -> newdir(...) in tests to help run under BSD-based systems.
	- Encode the 5 built-in XML character entities (within the node's value) when writing to an XML file.
		They are decoded by XML::Parser when the file is read back in.
	- Add scripts/xml.demo.pl and scripts/store.xml.
